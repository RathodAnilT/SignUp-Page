# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Future Tasks and Enhancements

# Form Validation

- Client-side Validation: Implement client-side validation for user inputs such as email format, password strength, and 
  required fields.
- Real-time Feedback: Provide real-time feedback to users while they fill out the form (e.g., password strength meter, email 
  availability check).

# Session Management

- User Authentication: Implement user authentication to maintain sessions across different pages.
- Token Storage: Use secure methods (e.g., HTTP-only cookies or localStorage) to store authentication tokens.
- Session Expiry: Implement automatic session expiration and re-authentication prompts for enhanced security.

 # Error Handling

- User-friendly Error Messages: Display user-friendly error messages for scenarios such as incorrect login credentials, network issues, or server errors.
- Form Reset on Error: Ensure forms reset or highlight incorrect fields when an error occurs during submission.

# Backend Integration

- API Setup: Develop or integrate with a backend API to handle user registration, login, and session management.
- Database Management: Set up a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) to store user information securely.
- Password Encryption: Implement password hashing and encryption using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., bcrypt)

# User Interface Enhancements

- Responsive Design: Ensure the form is fully responsive across different screen sizes and devices.
- Theming: Add theming support to allow users to switch between light and dark modes.

# Accessibility

- Keyboard Navigation: Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation.
- Screen Reader Support: Include proper ARIA labels and roles for screen reader support.

# Testing

- Unit Testing: Write unit tests for individual components to ensure they behave as expected.
- Integration Testing: Implement integration tests to validate the interaction between frontend and backend.
- End-to-End Testing: Use tools like Cypress or Selenium to perform end-to-end testing of the entire authentication flow.

# Security Enhancements

- CSRF Protection: Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection to prevent unauthorized actions.
- Rate Limiting: Add rate limiting to API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.
- CAPTCHA Integration: Integrate CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA to protect the signup and login forms from bots.
